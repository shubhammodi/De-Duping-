# De-Duping
In this project I have used Bag of Word and Tf-Idf algorithm to find the  duplicacy between documents. Within these documents we are targeting The fields like Judge Name, Case Number, Advocates and Party names etc to find out the duplicate documents. The duplicacy on online product is big drawback and impact the search results and linking adversely.
